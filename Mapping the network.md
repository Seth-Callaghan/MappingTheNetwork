# Mapping the network 

- web page

- login for profs student

- new project - project name , narrative, tags

- submits narrative -> define nodes ex select mode and level - mode ex: ideology, event...., level: regional, national ....

- link nodes. 

- so each project has nodes and you link different projects based on there nodes ( mermaid script?????? )

- a project can have multiple nodes

- ask if different nodes are related

- Gephi Tool - open source ( used for stats on graphs - uploads nodes and maps in csv form for Gephi to do stats on )



> personal I would prefer a desk top app as I could make that so much faster, but makes issue with searching for other peoples network narratives - unless there is a market place type page where it gets the stuff from data base then download the associated csv then recreate the graphs

Big network of all students narratives connected

If multi projects have there same node when merging there should only be one in the big map

Edit system for admin to user to add more nodes

> real issue is needing to store all the nodes relations - shouldn't be do difficult 

Weights based on number of times the relation of between two nodes is used - possibly
